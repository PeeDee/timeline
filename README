The timeline project is a ruby script to be used as a plug-in for Google Sketch.

Today being the occasion of my 50th birthday, and my practice being to update a timeline covering my life to date on this day every decade or so, I decided to write a script to do this rather than use some arbitrary graphics program (which never seem to hang around for 10 years anyway). I anticipate exporting the output as a tiff and jpeg, as well as saving the object definitions as a Google .kmz file. Hopefully that format will live on till my 60th.

In any case the data will be encoded in ruby and I'll have had fun.

Steps:
  1) Script will install a menu item to call the drawing routines.
  2) Methods will be defined for drawing axes, locations, schools, jobs, etc.
  3) Drawing methods will be read from a file and executed.

Possibilities (time permitting):
  a) Add object creation from the Draw menu.
  b) Editing of drawing items from a contextual menu
